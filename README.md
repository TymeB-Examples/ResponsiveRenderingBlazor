# ResponsiveRenderingBlazor
## Overview

This repository demonstrates responsive rendering techniques in Blazor, enabling components to adapt their layout and content dynamically based on the device screen size or rendering context.

Using Blazor concepts like `RenderFragment` and `RenderContext`, this example shows how to build performant, flexible UI components that seamlessly respond to varying viewport sizes.

## Features

- Adaptive UI rendering using Blazorâ€™s `RenderFragment` pattern  
- Context-aware rendering based on screen size or device characteristics (Prerender uses CSS and default rendering listens to JS event)
- Fallback strategies for both prerender as well as default rendering.
